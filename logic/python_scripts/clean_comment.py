# Python script for data base project
# clean the comment.csv file : problem with line breaks : SQLite cannot read properly the different rows/columns
# in this script : we rewrite the comment.csv as comment.txt : it create a long unique string 
#                   then we manually create the line break with the field subreddit_id : 
#                       since it is unique (same subreddit_id), we use it as criterion


# take comment.csv
# convert it as .txt
# replace subreddit_id with subreddit_id \n
# write as .csv


### thi script has to be run at the data_base folder level
